**CALL TO ACTION: I've noticed a sudden increase in interest for this project (I have no idea why!) but I simply don't have time to keep up with development. If you're interested in developing on this project, ask me and I'll give you access to the repository!**

**DISCLAIMER: The NXT-Python v3 implementation is incomplete. Development is not active due to lack of interest. Find the latest stable version for Python2 on the [releases](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/releases) page. Pull requests and improvements are very welcome!**

NXT-Python is a package for controlling a LEGO NXT robot using the Python programming language. It can communicate using either USB or Bluetooth. It is based on Marcus Wanner's work ending in 2013, which in turn is based on NXT_Python, where releases halted in May 2007.

## Requirements
* [Python 3.x](http://www.python.org)
* Bluetooth Comunications:
  * Linux/Windows: [PyBluez](https://github.com/karulis/pybluez)
  * Mac: [LightBlue](http://lightblue.sourceforge.net/)
* USB Communications:
  * [PyUSB](https://walac.github.io/pyusb/)
Fantom Communications:
  * [Pyfantom](http://pyfantom.ni.fr.eu.org/)

## Installation
1. Go and grab the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/releases) page - **the master branch is too unstable to use**
2. Untar/unzip source package
3. Navigate to the package directory, and run `python3 setup.py install`
4. `import nxt` in your program and get going!

*This is a quick overview, detailed instructions can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/wiki/Installation) page.*

## About v3
This version is part of the 3.x series of releases. Programs written for series 1.x or 2.x will not run properly or at all using this version, due API-breaking changes.
v3.x is functionally similar to v2.x, however is written for Python3 and as such will not behave correctly running code designed for Python2!
If you wish to run an older program, older versions can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/Eelviny/nxt-python/releases) page.

### Converting between versions
Since the 3.x and 2.x series use the same API, in most cases code can be automatically converted. Python2 and Python3 include a built in [2to3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html) script which will automatically modify the program.
However, there is no converter between the 1.x and 2.x series - it's very unlikely you will come across a 1.x program these days. Read the documentation and do it manually!

## Thanks to:
* Doug Lau for writing NXT_Python, our starting point.
* rhn for creating what would become v2, making lots of smaller changes, and reviewing tons of code.
* Marcus Wanner for maintaining NXT-Python up to v2.2.2, his work has been amazing!
* mindsensors.com (esp. Ryan Kneip) for helping out with the code for a lot of their sensors, expanding the sensors covered by the type checking database, and providing hardware for testing.
* HiTechnic for providing identification information for their sensors. I note that they have now included this information in their website. ;)
* Linus Atorf, Samuel Leeman-Munk, melducky, Simon Levy, Steve Castellotti, Paulo Vieira, zonedabone, migpics, TC Wan, jerradgenson, henryacev, Paul Hollensen, and anyone else I forgot for various fixes and additions.
* All our users for their interest and support!
