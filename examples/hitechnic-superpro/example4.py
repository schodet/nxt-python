"""
Experiment 4, adapted from the SuperPro demo

For this demo, attach a photo-resistor between A0 and 3V and a 4.7kOhm resistor between GND and A0.

Note: In testing I used a 10kOhm since I don't have 4.7kOhm handy.

It measures brightness and prints to the console. The brighter it is, the higher the voltage.

In my testing, a phone flashlight puts it to 3.2V and putting my hand over it results in 0.1V,
with natural light levels in my workspace being around 1.9-2.0V
